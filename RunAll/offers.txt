We believe in having a clear actionable standard set for daily action —a set of guiding stars that illuminate our path forward aligned with our vision and values. These principles aren't just words on paper; they're the essence of how we operate daily. They embody our collective values, define our behaviors, and steer our decision-making processes. They're the unwavering standards that anchor us in our pursuit of excellence. By embracing these principles, we empower each team member to act with confidence and purpose. They serve as our North Star, offering direction, alignment, and a constant reminder of who we are and what we stand for.\n\n\n * React to other peoples messages in group chats at a minimum once daily so everyone knows we are on the same page especially the person that put in the work. Alignment and appreciation is key.\n * Minimize communication overhead, make up your mind before meetings and conversation and if sending over information on any channel give a one sentence note on the rationale behind.\n * Stay humble in discussions. Be aware when a strong opinion or absolutistic statement arises that is often an unvalidated hypothesis. Our only job then is to clearly state the problem and test with the market. In most cases there is neither a right or wrong or black and white.\n * Be proactive and own. Especially in the early days, we require leaders, not followers, taking responsibility on their topics, setting and keeping the bar high.\n * Keep up a healthy effective communication. Everyone is responsible to pause and cut interaction immediately that runs into the wrong direction, both the person that started it and the person that continues.\n * Be on time, always, it's about respect for other people and the team's output. In any case there is any unforeseen delay, we give a written notice as early as we know to be late.\n * Only have intended meetings. Come in with a clear goal/problem statement, leave with an outcome delivery plan/solution. If meetings do not add value to your work or you can not add value to the conversation, you are allowed and encouraged to leave.\n * Execute with care and diligence. Keep files clean, check your spelling, document your work, deliver on a standard like if you were speaking in front of 1000 people or selling a book to 1M readers.\n * Neutralize weaknesses. Everyone has them, be always kind to yourself, however do not accept them to affect the team's standard to drop. Use tools to support you, the new digital age has it all, or discuss with the team on how someone with a strength in this field can support you.\n * Present a problem always with a solution draft If hitting a roadblock, take time to clearly state the problem and figure out some possible solution before interacting with the team for help. This is a thing of respect and ownership, others are not meant to fix the problem one is responsible for.\n   \n   \n\n🌟 Meet the Stellar Minds Behind Our Startup! 🌟\n\nAt the heart of our dynamic startup are two visionaries, Dana and Erik, whose passion and expertise set the tone for our journey. Supported by the incredible talents of Jonas and Adrian, our team is a vibrant blend of diverse skills and shared values.\n\nDana, our spirited co-founder, is a fitness enthusiast with a penchant for yoga and a love for the arts.
